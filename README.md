# Rotcrier

Rotcrier is a social network for people to share their thoughts, feelings, and concerns. It's a place where
people can show they can give a shit.

## Structure

Users must create an account and be logged in to create content.
Content falls into 3 categories:

Sections
Posts
Comments

### Sections

A Section is a way for user to create and moderate their own communities on Rotcrier. On rotcrier moderators can
remove comments and posts only, part of the philosophy of rotcrier is that unless they are breaking laws a person
still has the right to participate. Instances of individuals breaking laws should be brought to the attention Rotcrier
to investigate.

### Posts

A Post can be made within a section and can include links, and text. Users can comment on Posts, or show they
give a shit about the issue. Moderators can remove Posts if they feel they are not appropriate placed within that section.

### Comments

A comment can be made on a Post or other user's comments. Comments can be edited or deleted by the user or the Section's moderator.
Users can give a shit about the Comment and help it rise to the top.


## Rotcrier was made using a React front end, and a Nodejs/Express back-end.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` in either the 'client' or 'server' directories.

Client: 
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Server:
Starts the back end HTTP server, running on Port 3000.\

### `npm test` in the 'client' directory.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`  in the 'client' directory.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`  in the 'client' directory.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
